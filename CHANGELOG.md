## 0.1.2 — 2026-09-01

### ⚠️ Breaking: `intentId` is now required when signing

The SettlementHub now requires the ERC-3009 authorization nonce to equal the
intent id. **Signatures produced by 0.1.1 and earlier are rejected on-chain**,
so upgrading is not optional if you are signing payments.

```diff
- nonce = generate_nonce()
- typed = build_authorization_typed_data(payer, amount, hub, chain, nonce=nonce)
+ typed = build_authorization_typed_data(payer, amount, hub, chain, intent_id=intent_id)
```

Pass the **textual** intent id (`pi_…`) exactly as the API returns it. The SDK
derives the on-chain nonce itself; you do not need to hash anything. `intent_id_to_bytes32` is
exported if you want to verify the derivation.

The random-nonce generator has been **removed**. There is no migration path that
keeps it: a random nonce is precisely the defect this release fixes.

### Why

A signed authorization was not bound to any particular intent. Because USDC
enforces `msg.sender == to`, the signed `to` is always the hub and can never
name a merchant — so the payment destination was decided by calldata that the
routing node controls. A malicious node could redirect a payment and keep
**997 of every 1000 USDC**.

Reported externally and fixed in ADR-004. Full write-up:

### Also

- Protocol fee is now **1.5%** (ADR-005), split 70/30 as before: 1.05% to the
  routing node, 0.45% to the treasury.
